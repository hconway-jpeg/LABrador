<h4>Requirements and Caveats:</h4>

Requires a MySQL database connection and schema to function properly - details are in the repository or you can set your own up in the **application.properties** file.

<h5>Google Sign-In exists on the front page but does not work in a locally hosted instance - it requires a deployed instance and set-up online/cloud-based domain to work.</h5>
